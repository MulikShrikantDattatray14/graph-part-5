Problem Statement: You are given an n, m which means the row and column of the 2D matrix, and an array of size k denoting the number of operations. Matrix elements are 0 if there is water or 1 if there is land. Originally, the 2D matrix is all 0 which means there is no land in the matrix. The array has k operator(s) and each operator has two integers A[i][0], A[i][1] means that you can change the cell matrix[A[i][0]][A[i][1]] from sea to island. Return how many islands are there in the matrix after each operation. You need to return an array of size k.

Note: An island means a group of 1s such that they share a common side.
