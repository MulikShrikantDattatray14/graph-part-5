Problem Statement: Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph of V vertices and E edges. The task is to find the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
(Sometimes it may be asked to find the MST as well, where in the MST the edge-informations will be stored in the form {u, v}(u = starting node, v = ending node).)
