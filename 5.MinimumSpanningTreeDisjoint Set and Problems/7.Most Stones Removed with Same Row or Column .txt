Problem Statement: There are n stones at some integer coordinate points on a 2D plane. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

You need to remove some stones. 

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array of stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the maximum possible number of stones that you can remove.
